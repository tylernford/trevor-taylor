        <p class='lh-copy mb0'>We created a quick proof of concept to see if our audience was interested in the idea of tracing and designing their own footwear. It proved to be very popular.</p>

        <p class='lh-copy mb0'>I then needed to consider how the experience would function and what it would look like. To get things off the ground, I created a number of to-scale models to communicate my ideas to the curator and get tips on construction from SMOâ€™s exhibit team.</p>"

Individuals worked in teams to problem solve a section of the chain reaction, then worked together with the teams adjacent to them to connect everything together."

As the design lead, it was my job to decide how to recreate the space to privilege facilitated experiences and train the individuals that would staff the space. I researched and acquired furniture, technology, and tools for the space. I then spent several months working in the space developing a catalogue of offerings. Tinkering Garage consists of a large open space that was designed to be flexible enough to accommodate a number of experiences. The back of the space features a lab stocked with rapid prototyping technology used by the staff to prototype new experiences."
